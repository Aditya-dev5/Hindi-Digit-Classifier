## ANN based Hindi-Digit Classifier ##
This is a simplistic implementation of training a multilayer perceptron model to classify 'Hindi' digits from 0-9. Download the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imbikramsaha/hindi-mnist and save it the 'Dataset' folder. Run the train.py for required number of epochs and observe the error evolution.
